1. I would fit my automated testswithin a GitHub action that runs whenever my code is pushed in my Recipe project development pipeline. This would be efficient and best for incremental development since it can help catch potential bugs early each push by validating the changes. This also prevents broken code from being merged into the main branch.
2. No, I would not use an end-to-end test to check if a function is returning the right output since E2E tests are tests that emulate user actions from start to finish. A unit test would be more suitable for checking if a function is returning the right output.
3. In Lighthouse, the difference between navigation mode and snapshot mode is that navigation mode loads and analyzes the full webpage, which is helpful for testing and evaluating the site like an actual user. On the other hand, snapshot mode takes a "snapshot" of the current state of the site without navigation, which is much more helpful for observing the site's performance and accessibility.
4.  Some things we could improve on the site are:
   - Compressing the images to make the website performance more optimal since we could potentially save 518KB.
   - Add a meta description to concisely summarize page content in search results. 
   - Add a lang attribute to the html element to help with accessibility for all users.
